# PDFium-.NET-Wrapper

This project creates a .NET DLL for PDF functionality needed in our PDF-Scanning-App:

https://github.com/leighwoltman/PDF-Scanning-App

The DLL is based on PDFium library with some customizations over the original code:

Currently only select functionality is made available in the DLL however the implementation can be easily extended over the rest of the PDFium features.
